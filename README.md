# Propuestas de Mejora Chaucha (PMC)
*Chaucha Improvement Proposals*

People wishing to submit PMCs, first should propose their idea or document as an *[issue](https://github.com/proyecto-chaucha/pmc/issues)* in this repo. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving PMCs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a PMC here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes *Final* or *Active*.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Chaucha users (see also: [economic majority](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Economic_majority)).

PMC will follow [Bitcoin's BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki) but in a more flexible way.

See [Template File](template.mediawiki) For example PMC.
